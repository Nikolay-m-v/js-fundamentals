// Write a JS program that calculates how much resources will be required for the construction of a pyramid. It is made out of stone, marble, lapis lazuli, and gold.
// Your program will receive an integer that will be the base width and length of the pyramid and an increment that is the height of each step.
// The bulk is made out of stone, while the outer layer is made out of marble. Every fifth stepâ€™s outer layer is made out of lapis lazuli instead of marble. The final step is made out of gold.
// The pyramid is built with 1x1 blocks with a height equal to the given increment.
// The first step of the pyramid has a width and length equal to the given base and every next step is reduced by 2 blocks (1 from each side).
// The height of every step equals the given increment. See the drawing for an example.
// White steps are covered in marble, blue steps are covered in lapis lazuli (every fifth layer from the bottom), and yellow steps are made entirely out of gold (top-most step).
// Since the outer layer of each step is made of decorative material, to calculate the required stone for one step,
// reduce the width and length by 2 blocks (one from each side), find its area, and multiply it by the increment.
// The rest of the step is made out of lapis lazuli for every fifth step from the bottom and marble for all other steps.
// To find the amount needed, you may, for example, find its perimeter and reduce it by 4 (to compensate for the overlapping corners), and multiply the result by the increment.
// See the drawing for details (grey is stone, white is decoration).
